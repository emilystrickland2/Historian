Ever since I was a little girl I fell in love with space and wanted to learn more about. I even wanted to be an astronaut at one point but that is no longer the case because I do not want to die in space. My research pertain to Moon rocks and their use as artifacts and how they are important historical pieces of the Apollo. My goal is to be the best space historian of my generation.
