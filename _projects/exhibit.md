<p align="left, bottom">Making an exhibit requires a lot of planning and studying. During summer of 2019, I got the opportunity to intern at the Brevard Museum of History and Natural Science. My supervisor Holly gave me complete creative control over the display of the exhibit after the artifacts were procured. I started with a drawing that I turned into a picture on Microsoft paint so I can have a better visualization of my design. 

We had to paint the wall black and I was left to make the Moon and Earth mural. I then hung up all of the pictures and organized all the piece that went on the shelf. The hardest part of the set up was putting together the mannequin within the suit as it had to be put together while in the suit since it was given to the museum in that state by a private collector.

This experience eased any doubt that I would not love curation. I could see myself creating exhibits for the rest of my life and I cannot wait until I get the chance to do this again. </p>
