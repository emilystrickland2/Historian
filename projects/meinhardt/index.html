<p>Going on a research trip can be very serious and you think that your work should be your only concern. This is a quite boring way to think. Use the experience you gain from a research trip to learn about yourself. Have an adventure. Learn from the research and learn from the fun. Research trips should not just be ridged and boring. You want to enjoy your time. If you add a little fun to work, then it becomes a game. Every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake like Mary Poppins once said. 
I took a research trip to DC. This trip was scary because I was without anyone that I know, and it was quite lonely. It is because I was going to be alone that I took a bear that was given to me, so I had some form of company. Once I found a way to enjoy myself during my trip it became so much easier to be alone. I became a pro at the DC metro after 1 trip. I learned so much at the Smithsonian. The best part of the trip was my final day right before I had to go to the airport. I went to the National Mall and took pictures of the bear as if he were a tourist visiting the city. I have dubbed my collection as “Meinhardt Take the Capital.” With an hour and a half wait between the time that I checked out of the hotel to the time that I had until I had to be at the airport, going on a wacky adventure.</p>

<p>“Meinhardt Takes the Capital”
Meinhardt is a bear that was purchased off Amazon for Me, Emily, from Nick because he had to leave for work to chase a bright and exciting career. Meinhardt was given his name because it is German which is a heritage that both Nick and I share. The name means bravery and strength which were qualities I need to develop while I started a long-distance relationship. Meinhardt is a symbol of my relationship and an embodiment of my courage that I sometimes cannot find within myself.
The several locations that Meinhardt was photographed at were the Smithsonian, the National Mall, and the National Archives. My personal favorite image is “Meinhardt Waits for the Metro”. This is because I watched a young woman smile as I set him up. This picture was also scary to take because if you know anything about metro stations the trains cause a gust of wind that could have easily knock the poor bear onto the tracks. It is because of this factor I had to take a lot of care on my timing, plus I did not want to me my train.
Meinhardt takes the Capital emphases the kinds of person I am. I am weird and creative. During the process of taking these pictures I notices that people were smiling and enjoy my work. This collection should cause the viewers to be more like him and have fun and travel. Be brave and take the chance of an unforgettable adventure even though it is scary because it may turn out to be more fun than you could have ever imagined.</p>
