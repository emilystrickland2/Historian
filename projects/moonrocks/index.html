<p>Most would say that the pinnacle of the Space Race was when the United States landed on the Moon. Besides the countless videos and images, what is the proof that the U.S. was there? Moon rocks are tangible evidence that the U.S. was on the Moon. Once the moon rocks came to Earth, they were studied, distributed, and displayed. The goal of this research is to examine the displays and narratives of the Apollo lunar samples. Understanding where and how the rocks ended up in their earthly homes around the country allows for analysis of the historical and cultural impacts of these rocks. It is important to understand the Moon and its history because the lunar landings were a major part of the 1960s in the United States. My research involves hunting down the lunar samples that are across the U.S. and working with several institutions to gather the stories of their lunar samples. My research shows that the lunar samples are not only rocks and pebbles but they are objects that share different stories about the history of Apollo and, therefore, are an important part of Apollo’s legacy.</p>

<p>There are different kinds of lunar samples displayed across the country. There are three main groups of lunar displays across the country and the world: the Goodwill Moon Rocks, the lunar samples that were petitioned for by museums across the United States, and the Ambassador of Exploration Award. These groups of displays serve different purposes within the history of Apollo and their goals when connecting with the public. The Apollo lunar missions brought back about 842 pounds of lunar material. The collection of lunar materials was a key scientific goal of the Apollo missions. The significance of the lunar samples is undisputed because of their scientific contribution and their public display. The knowledge gained from the lunar samples and the distribution to the public through media and educational material has been a lasting part of the Apollo legacy. Lunar material that is on display connects the public with the past and is used to share the numerous achievements and research of the Apollo program even though it is just rocks and dirt.</p>
