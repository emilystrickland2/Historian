I began the process of this site as something to be scared of. I was absolutely correct to believe that months ago. It is a scary process and I have broken this site repeatedly. I have collaborated with the internet, webcourses, Dr. Salter and my twin to fix the things I have broken. Though far from done this site it going to be a great place to showcase my growing work.
